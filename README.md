# War - A Simple C++ Card Game

This is a basic implementation of the classic card game **War**, created in C++.

It's my first time working with C++, and I built this project to explore the language and get some hands-on programming experience.

I know the code isn't perfect — it definitely needs some refactoring and cleanup — but this is just a temporary version. It's a small, personal project and a **baby step** in my journey to becoming more comfortable with C++.

Feel free to explore, fork, or leave feedback!
